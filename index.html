<h2>Vision</h2><br>

  <p>Salish Social Policy Design and Practice (SSPDP) will prepare an increasing number of non-profit, private, and government sectors with the confidence to lead social policy change through Indigenous worldviews, transforming how we design and practice social policy. </p><br>



<h3>Mission</h3><br>
